# texada

This project is only partially complete.  Pagination features were not implemented.  A primitive data validation scheme that checks for data type was devised.  Database was created using pandas and sql alchemy.  

API can successfully communicate to database and retrieve records based on unique ID.  API can also append new records to the database.
